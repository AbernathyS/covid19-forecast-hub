    This metapopulation county-level SEIR model makes projections of future COVID-19 incidence and deaths.  We produce a number of different intervention scenarios, each assuming various interventions and rates of compliance are implemented in the future.  This scenario assumes a weekly 20% decrease in counties with growing weekly cases and stay-at-home orders in place, and a one-time 5% increase in states that have reopened.

    This model makes predictions about the future that are dependent on a particular set 
    of assumptions about how interventions are implemented and how effective they are. 
    Estimates of spatio-temporal COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations and deaths were 
    calculated for all US counties. 
    April 5: Originally, we implemented 3 hypothetical control scenarios to reflect reduced contact between individuals due to stay-at-home orders, as well as reactive personal decisions to limit social contacts: starting from 14 days prior to the projection day, we applied 20%, 30% and 40% weekly reductions of the contact rate (β) in counties with ≥10 reported cases in a week, until the weekly numbers of new confirmed case in those counties decreased (i.e., the curve flattened). 
    May 3: Here, we modify our earlier control scenarios to account for increases in contact rates due to loosening restrictions in states that have begun to reopen economically. We project three scenarios. In the first two scenarios, for states maintaining or increasing current social distancing restrictions, we continue to apply the 20% weekly reductions of contact rates, as described above. However, in states that reopen, we apply an increase to the contact rate of counties in those states. In the first scenario, we apply a one-time 10% increase to the contact rate during the week that the state is scheduled to reopen and maintain this new increased rate for the remainder of the projection.  In the second scenario, the contact rate is increased by an additional 10% each week to represent progressive loosening of restrictions and increased public confidence and frequenting of businesses.  A third comparison scenario assumes no effect due to reopening, and instead applies 20% weekly reductions in contact rates for all counties meeting the criteria described above.
    May 7: In addition to the previous reopening scenarios, we consider a one-time 5% increase (80contact1x5p) and a weekly 5% increase (80contactw5p) in states that have reopened.
