    Data-driven approach based on deep learning for forecasting mortality and hospitalizations using syndromic, clinical, demographic, mobility and point-of-care data.
    The model makes predictions about the future assuming that the effect of the current social distancing measures and patterns are reflected in the input data and these measures remain constant in near future. 
    However, as the data is updated each week in real time, we update to capture the effects of the most recent intervention measures and distancing patterns.

    May 11 - This data-driven deep learning model learns the dependence of hospitalization and mortality rate on various detailed syndromic, demographic, mobility and clinical data (such as increase in positive Covid tests etc) from historical data. The learned model is then used to predict mortality and hospitalization at various points in future. To compensate for the effects of noise (in data and initialization), the model is bootstrapped on several subsamples and then aggregated. The model also propagates uncertainties in the data to show the confidence intervals in the forecasts.
