    NOTE: On May 7, 2020 the New York Timesâ€™ made substantial changes in how it reports COVID-19 deaths, with a large effect on data New York state in particular. We are working our way through the implications of these changes for our model. In the meantime, we are using data from Johns Hopkins University, which includes both probable and confirmed deaths, to inform our projections
    This model makes predictions assuming that social distancing patterns, as measured by anonymized mobile-phone GPS traces, remain constant in the future.  However, we receive this data in real time to update forecasts on a weekly basis.  This model models only *first-wave deaths*.

    For each US state, we use local data from mobile-phone GPS traces made available by [SafeGraph] to quantify the changing impact of social-distancing measures on ``flattening the curve.''  SafeGraph is a data company that aggregates anonymized location data from numerous applications in order to provide insights about physical places. To enhance privacy, SafeGraph excludes census block group information if fewer than five devices visitedan establishment in a month from a given census block group.  These data are aggregated by state to create metrics of social distancing, which are used as predictors in the model.
    We use a Bayesian multilevel negative binomial regression model for the number of deaths for each day, and implement the model in R using the rstanarm package.
